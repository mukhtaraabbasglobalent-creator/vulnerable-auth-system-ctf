# Vulnerable Authentication System (CTF Practice)

This project is a deliberately vulnerable authentication system built
for cybersecurity learning and Capture The Flag (CTF) practice.

⚠️ **Warning:** This application is intentionally insecure and MUST NOT be used in production.

## 🔓 Demonstrated Vulnerabilities

- Authentication bypass (Broken Access Control)
- Plain-text password storage (CWE-256)
- Legacy authentication protocol usage
- Missing encryption enforcement
- Firewall misconfiguration

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Identify authentication flaws
- Understand why plain-text passwords are dangerous
- Map vulnerabilities to CWE and OWASP Top 10
- Practice secure system design and remediation
