# Vulnerable Authentication System (CTF Practice)

This project is a deliberately vulnerable authentication system built for
cybersecurity learning and Capture The Flag (CTF) practice.

⚠️ **Warning:** This application is intentionally insecure and MUST NOT be used in production.

---

## 🔓 Demonstrated Vulnerabilities

- Authentication bypass (Broken Access Control)
- Plain-text password storage (**CWE-256**)
- Legacy authentication protocol usage
- Missing encryption enforcement
- Insecure security configuration (Firewall misconfiguration)

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

This project was created to help learners and junior security professionals:

- Understand common authentication vulnerabilities
- Practice identifying insecure implementations
- Map vulnerabilities to **CWE** and **OWASP Top 10**
- Learn how insecure systems are exploited in real-world scenarios
- Compare vulnerable vs secure authentication designs
